## 2. Pipeline Snapshot
| Stage | Account | Opportunity | Est. Value | Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Prospecting | Occidental / 1PointFive | CCUS relief-ready retainer | $750k | Draft CCUS compliance brief, request intro via LinkedIn. |
| Prospecting | Fervo Energy | EGS intersection services | $500k | Send “world-record intercept” case study to drilling VP. |
| Prospecting | CalGEM | High-difficulty P&A package | $1.2M | Pull latest orphan-well RFP schedule, prep proposal template. |
| Prospecting | Hy Stor Energy | Cavern connection assessment | $600k | Map decision-makers, outline hydrogen cavern scope. |
| Ideation | Gunnar AI Advisory | Automation pilot | $250k | Design offering outline + pricing tiers, align with internal AI stack. |

## 3. Action Items (Top 5)
1. Build CCUS relief-ready one-pager + compliance checklist (closes Occidental/Talos conversations).
2. Extract details from the Boyle Heights project for a plug-and-abandon case study (supports CalGEM/DOE bids).
3. Script Gunnar YouTube shorts highlighting the deepest intercept + HSE projects → drive inbound.
4. Pull public Class VI permit filings to identify all CCUS operators lacking relief plans.
5. Prototype AI-assisted ranging advisory workflow (internal pilot using Gunnar data + OpenClaw).

## 4. Automation Hooks
- **RFP Scraper:** Monitor state procurement portals (CA, NM, CO, LA) for “well plugging” / “relief well” keywords. Alert to WhatsApp when new bids drop.
- **LinkedIn Listener:** Track mentions of “Gunnar Energy Services” or leadership for lead opportunities.
- **CCUS Permit Monitor:** Weekly check on EPA Class VI filings for upcoming projects needing relief contracts.
- **Content Scheduler:** Use OpenClaw heartbeat/cron to remind us about content releases (YouTube/LinkedIn).

## 5. Notes & Assumptions
- Revenue estimates based on typical day rates + retainer structures for high-risk well-control work.
- All figures will be refined as we capture real quotes and contact info.
- Dashboard will evolve into a richer UI (possibly static site) once data volume increases.
