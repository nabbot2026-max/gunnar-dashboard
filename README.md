# Gunnar Revenue Command Center (WIP)

This directory will hold the lightweight dashboard + data files for Gunnar Energy Services: prospects, revenue targets, outreach status, and automation hooks.

### Planned structure
- `dashboard.md` (quick-view board)
- `pipeline.json` (structured list of prospects + deal stages)
- `tasks.md` (action items + owners)
- `assets/` (pitch decks, one-pagers, case study PDFs)
- `scripts/` (helpers to pull RFPs, monitor LinkedIn, etc.)

All output will sync with the main workspace once the UI is ready.
